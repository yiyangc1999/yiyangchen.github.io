#### Immunofluorescent Biomarker for Zebrafish Somitogenesis and Single-cell Oscillation

***Research Assistant***, 07/2019-09/2019, Ann Arbor, United States

Department of Biophysics, Supervisor: [Qiong Yang](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~qiongy/)

- Developed two-color immunofluorescent protocols for Ntla and Tbx16 in both zebrafish embryos and cell dispersals to identify the types of oscillating cells and non-oscillatory cells removed from the tailbud
- Determined different experimental conditions for embryo and cell dispersion systems after continuous trails
- Distinguished oscillating cells in different phenotypes: PSM, Progenitor, and Somite by the common images and Z-stack images taken by confocal microscope
- Left the images with good experiment results for lab use

#### Sorting Human Erythrocytes in Different Life Stages based on Microfluidic Technology

***Project Leader***, *National College Students Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program*, 04/2019-03/2021, Tianjin, China

School of Physics, Supervisor: [Leiting Pan](http://panltlab.org/)

- Investigated the influence of erythrocyte aging process on the deformability decrease
- Conducted human erythrocyte deformability measuring and hydrodynamic cell sorting based on microfluidic channels
- Artificially controlled the life stages by storing in vitro and processed the erythrocyte by *hydrogen peroxide* treatment to change the erythrocyte deformability and prepare for the chip test of cell sorting
- Revised and designed the microfluidic ratchet chip to complete the cell sorting
